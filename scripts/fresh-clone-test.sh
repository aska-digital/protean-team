# fleet: clones to a temp dir, runs the documented reproduce command, asserts
# the instantiated team exists + the audit is honest (shipped count closes
# against on-disk files, no ghost rows).
#
# The frozen committed artifacts (manifest.frozen.tsv, REVIEW.frozen.md) make
# the clone self-contained; this script is the proof, wired as the pre-commit
# gate's final step.
