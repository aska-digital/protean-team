"""
generate.py — The generator (build step 3). Manifest → instantiated kit.

THE ONLY ASSEMBLY PATH. A kit that cannot be built by this script from
templates/ + a parameter file does not exist.

Contract (spec section 4):
  - Declarative: reads the manifest; each TEMPLATE row maps to a template
    target with {PLACEHOLDER} substitutions. No hand-edited output.
  - One engine, two products: open core = engine + generic templates;
    vertical packs = parameter file fed through the SAME generator.
  - Cross-class seams emit provenance comments in the output.
  - Authored-fresh public files (AUTHORED_FRESH below) are copied verbatim —
    they have no manifest row by design and are never placeholder-substituted.

USAGE
  python3 generate.py --out <kit-dir> [--params <parameter-file.yaml>]
    --params optional: vertical-pack parameter file (persona set, skill
            bundle, choreography). Without it, generates the generic open
            core (default persona archetypes).

Preconditions (enforced):
  sweep-gate.py  == 0   (source clean + fully classified)
  review-gate.py == 0   (semantic sign-off complete)

Placeholder scheme: every {PLACEHOLDER} in templates/ resolves from:
  1. the parameter file (vertical pack), or
  2. DEFAULT_PARAMS (open core), or
  3. a per-row override table below.
